The Religion & Bible Society of the Rocky Mountain Great Plains Region (RBS) was formerly the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Region of both the [American Academy of Religion](http://aarweb.org) and the Society of Biblical Literature. In 2022, the SBL abolished their regional structure and withdrew financial support from regional organizations. However, those of us in RMGP remain committed to our region, the scholarship we do, and the important professional development opportunity that the RMGP Regional Meeting has become.
The Religion & Bible Society was incorporated November 3, 2022, in the state of Colorado and was granted federal 501(c)3 status December 16, 2022. At this time, it serves the same functions as the former AAR/SBL regions (AAR maintains its regional structure), with a slightly modified leadership structure that will allow the Religion & Bible Society to expand opportunities for scholars in the RMGP Region, especially its junior and student scholars.

## Student Representatives

The AAR has a regional student position that addresses the needs and concerns of graduate students and promotes their professional development and participation in our regional organization:

[AAR Graduate Student Committee](https://www.aarweb.org/node/108)

Student Representatives serve the regional and national organization of AAR. As such, the region would like to offer their financial support:

Student Representatives have a waived registration fee for the regional meeting. They should contact the meeting organizer as soon as possible when registration opens to arrange this.
Student Representatives are required to pursue funding from the university with which they are affiliated before they submit requests to the region. If no such funding is available, student representatives should indicate this when requesting financial support.
Student Representatives may submit costs for hotel rooms, airfare, and food. The region requires that reimbursements for hotel rooms will be made at the AAR rate that is published by the national organization for the annual meetings, that airfare must be coach/economy, and food will not be reimbursed higher than the annual federal per diem rates. The same requirements will apply to the regional meeting. Financial support is capped at $500 for each student representative for an academic year (one national and one regional meeting).
To receive financial support, student representatives must submit (1) itemized receipts for all costs for which they are requesting reimbursement and (2) a list of funding resources for which they have applied at their home universities (or a statement that no such funding is available) within 60 days of each meeting.
Student Representatives are expected to make every reasonable effort to be present to report on their activities at the Regional Business Meeting (scheduled each Spring at the regional meeting). 
Please contact the [current president](https://iliff.github.io/rmgp/#regional-officers) for more information.
